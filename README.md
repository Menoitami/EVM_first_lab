# Bit Manipulation Program

## Overview

This program, developed in C++, allows users to perform bit manipulation on integers and long double numbers. The program can display the binary representation of the numbers, swap groups of bits within the numbers, and update the original number based on the bit manipulation.

## Features

- **Display Binary Representation**: Show the binary representation of an integer or long double number.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Swap groups of bits within the binary representation of the number.
- **Supports Integer and Long Double**: Works with both integer and long double data types.

## Requirements

- C++17 or higher
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
